Computer science no longer imtimidate me.

<!--more-->

Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, I just finished reading this book,
not the original one, but the JavaScript Edition.
It took me four months, I started from the original version, but kept feeling
frustrated about the syntax of Scheme and those outdated jargons, so I switched to
the JS Edition since the middle part of chapter two, it's much easier to read,
although I don't like JavaScript very much either like many others on the internet.

So what did I learned? I can't say there's a lot, because I didn't remember much
about the examples from the book. But I truly get something, I'm being more familiar
with recursion, and programming language is no longer being mystery
to me after finished the first three chapters. In the last two chapters,
it give me a chance to glance at inside of interpreter and compiler, even hardware.
I did not fully understand, however, it opened my eyes, way more than I thought.

Most important, it tells me that computer systems are all about abstractions,
layer by layer. If you can't understand something, just ignore it for a moment,
treat it as a magic black box, and focus on the higher level above it, then go back
when you feel confident. Don't intimidate your self with some kind fancy imagination
because of "fear of the unknown". I think this should be the first thing learned
by a novice, so to speak, every programmer should read this book. However,
it's not much friendly to beginners, it's difficult, especially for self learners like myself.
Then when is the right time to read it? Let me tell you my experience.

I've heared about SICP for like seven years,
tried and was intimidated during the time until these days. Why now? Because I feel that
I am hitting a plateau, I can handle ordinary development tasks, but can't understand
the low level details. I tried to find a way to improve, read about this advice
"Learn at least one new language every year" which is from the book "The Pragmatic Programmer".
But I'm sure it won't work for me, even I do as it says, I could only scratch on
the surface of those languages, learning similar syntax with little variation
over and over again.

My problem is lacking of fundamental systematic knowledge,
so I searched for resources about self learning computer science, led me to this website
[teachyourselfcs.com](https://teachyourselfcs.com/), the subjects they suggest are convincible,
also SICP is the first book they suggest to read. Then, finally, I decided to follow this guide,
seriously, with patience, and I did well.

The next book is CSAPP, to be contined.
